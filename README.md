# Coding-Design-Summer-2023
This is where I will be putting my code for my Coding and Design project. I will self-pace myself to finish 2 bundles and complete them in a timely manner. I will attend meetings 2x a week with my scrum mastet where I will keep up to date on how I'm doing on my timeline, and can ask questions when needed. I will submit a project each course to continue onto the next course within the bundle. This program is consist of 30% technical training coursework, where I will be programming, design thinking, and problem solve in order to learn the skills I need to learn theoretically. All that will be put into the other 70% of project building, where I can create things that the skills I've learnt from the course challenges, and put it to use where I can create a mini project out of it.
